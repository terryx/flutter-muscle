# github_provider

A demo flutter project calling Github API.

The goal of this project is to demostrate <b>how to test</b> a flutter application using unit test and widget test.

## Getting Started

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Motivation

Flutter will be next great framework for building cross platform mobile app. The flutter github project stars has already surpassed react native in mere months. However there are far too many issues on flutter reported which are not related to the framework bug but rather user mistakes.

Great community also comes with great pile of shit codes as many beginners tend to jump get started without test case. I urge flutter instrutors, tutors, teachers and hobbiysts add test in your videos, articles and tutorials. Teach students by writing and reading test cases can bring greater clarity and intent of why and how a piece of code is structured.
